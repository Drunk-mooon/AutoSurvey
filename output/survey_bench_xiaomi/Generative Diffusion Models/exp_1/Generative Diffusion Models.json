As introduced in the preceding discussion on the limitations of GANs and VAEs, diffusion models provide a compelling alternative that combines training stability with high-fidelity output. At their core, these models are defined by a two-stage process: a fixed, forward diffusion process that incrementally corrupts data by adding noise, and a learned, reverse diffusion process that recovers the data from pure noise [1]. This approach transforms the generative task into a sequence of denoising steps, allowing the model to learn the intricate structure of the data distribution by gradually reversing a controlled degradation.\n\nThe fundamental intuition behind diffusion models is loosely inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics, where a system is slowly driven away from equilibrium by the addition of entropy [2]. In the context of machine learning, this translates to a Markov chain that slowly adds random noise to data until it converges to a simple isotropic Gaussian distribution. This forward process is mathematically tractable and does not require learning. The generative capability, however, lies in the reverse process. The model is trained to learn the transition probabilities of this reverse chain, effectively learning to remove the noise step-by-step to reconstruct the original data. This iterative refinement allows the model to capture complex, high-dimensional distributions with remarkable fidelity [3].\n\nUnlike GANs, which involve a delicate adversarial training dynamic often prone to mode collapse and instability, diffusion models offer stable training objectives, typically derived from maximum likelihood estimation or variational bounds. They differ from VAEs by not relying on a distinct encoder network to map data to a compressed latent space; instead, the \"latent\" variables in diffusion models are the noisy versions of the data itself, maintaining the same dimensionality throughout the process [2]. This structure allows diffusion models to achieve state-of-the-art results in diverse domains, including image synthesis, video generation, and molecule design [4].\n\nThe iterative nature of the reverse process, while contributing to high sample quality, introduces computational overhead compared to single-pass generative models. However, recent advancements have focused on mitigating this through various sampling acceleration techniques and architectural optimizations. The core concept remains the transformation of a complex data distribution into a noise distribution and the subsequent learning of the trajectory back to the data manifold. This process is not merely a restoration of lost information but a structured exploration of the data space, guided by the learned score function\u2014the gradient of the log-probability density of the perturbed data [5].\n\nIn summary, generative diffusion models provide a powerful framework for synthesizing data by reversing a gradual noising process. Their ability to model complex distributions with high fidelity and training stability has established them as a cornerstone of modern generative AI, driving innovations across vision, audio, and scientific domains. This foundational understanding sets the stage for the following sections, which will delve into the specific mathematical formulations and architectural choices that enable these capabilities.\n\n### 1.2 Contrast with Other Deep Generative Models\n\nGenerative diffusion models have rapidly ascended to the forefront of artificial intelligence, establishing themselves as the dominant paradigm for high-fidelity data synthesis across diverse modalities. To fully appreciate their significance, it is essential to situate them within the broader landscape of deep generative modeling, which has historically been dominated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). While both have achieved remarkable successes, they possess fundamental limitations regarding training stability, mode coverage, and sample quality. Diffusion models effectively address many of these shortcomings, offering a compelling alternative that combines the stability of VAEs with the sample quality often associated with GANs, albeit at a distinct computational cost.\n\n**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**\n\nIntroduced in 2014, GANs revolutionized generative modeling by framing the task as a minimax game between two competing networks: a generator that creates synthetic data and a discriminator that attempts to distinguish real data from fake. This adversarial training process encourages the generator to produce increasingly realistic samples. GANs are renowned for their ability to synthesize sharp, photorealistic images, often surpassing other methods in perceptual quality.\n\nHowever, GANs are notoriously difficult to train. The primary challenge is maintaining equilibrium in the adversarial game; if the discriminator becomes too strong too quickly, the generator receives vanishing gradients and learning stalls. Conversely, if the generator outpaces the discriminator, the system fails to provide useful feedback. This instability manifests as \"mode collapse,\" a phenomenon where the generator produces limited varieties of samples, effectively ignoring vast portions of the target data distribution. As noted in the literature, GANs frequently face issues such as mode collapse, which limits the diversity of the generated outputs [6]. Furthermore, the adversarial nature of GANs makes it difficult to derive a principled objective function for evaluating likelihood or ensuring coverage of the data distribution. While GANs excel in sample fidelity, their lack of training stability and diversity control remains a significant barrier to their universal application.\n\n**Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**\n\nVariational Autoencoders offer a probabilistic framework for generative modeling. VAEs consist of an encoder that maps input data to a latent distribution and a decoder that reconstructs the data from samples in this latent space. The training objective maximizes a lower bound on the data likelihood (ELBO), which balances reconstruction accuracy with the regularization of the latent space, typically encouraging it to match a simple prior like a Gaussian distribution.\n\nVAEs are appreciated for their stable training dynamics and the interpretable latent representations they learn.

The primary disadvantage of diffusion models compared to GANs and VAEs is computational efficiency. GANs and VAEs typically generate samples in a single forward pass. In contrast, diffusion models require iterative refinement over hundreds or thousands of steps. This sequential nature significantly increases inference latency and energy consumption. While techniques like Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) and advanced ODE/SDE solvers (e.g., DDIM, DPM-Solver) have mitigated these costs, diffusion models remain computationally heavier during inference than their counterparts [7].\n\nIn summary, diffusion models represent a significant evolution in generative AI. They trade the single-step efficiency of GANs and VAEs for superior training stability, robust mode coverage, and state-of-the-art sample quality. This trade-off has proven worthwhile for applications requiring high fidelity and diversity, cementing diffusion models as the current standard for generative tasks.\n\n### 1.3 Origins in Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics\n\nThe conceptual underpinnings of generative diffusion models are deeply rooted in the principles of non-equilibrium statistical physics and thermodynamics. This paradigm shift is directly inspired by the physical laws governing the diffusion of particles and the inevitable increase of entropy in isolated systems. The core idea, as articulated in foundational works like [8], is to systematically and slowly destroy the structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process, and then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores this structure. This approach allows for the creation of highly flexible and tractable generative models, bridging the gap between the stable training of VAEs and the high-quality sampling of GANs by leveraging a well-defined, non-adversarial objective.\n\nTo understand this connection, we must first recall the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. In a physical context, this implies that systems tend to evolve from ordered to disordered states. A classic example is the diffusion of a drop of ink in a glass of water. Initially, the ink is concentrated in a small region (low entropy, high order), but over time, the random thermal motion of molecules causes the ink to spread out until it is uniformly distributed throughout the water (high entropy, high disorder). This process is irreversible in practice; one does not observe the ink spontaneously re-concentrating into a drop. The forward process in diffusion models mimics this physical diffusion. It starts with a data point, \\( x_0 \\), drawn from the complex data distribution \\( q(x_0) \\), and iteratively adds a small amount of Gaussian noise over a series of timesteps \\( t = 1, \\dots, T \\). This creates a sequence of increasingly noisy data points \\( x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_T \\), where \\( x_T \\) is approximately pure Gaussian noise. This forward process is a Markov chain where each step is defined by a conditional distribution \\( q(x_t | x_{t-1}) \\), typically chosen to be a Gaussian distribution whose mean is a function of \\( x_{t-1} \\) and whose variance is controlled by a \"noise schedule.\" This gradual corruption ensures that the data distribution is transformed into a simple, known prior distribution, effectively tracing a path of increasing entropy [2].\n\nThe connection to non-equilibrium thermodynamics is not merely metaphorical; it is formalized through the mathematics of stochastic processes, specifically Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). The discrete forward process can be viewed as a discretization of a continuous-time diffusion process described by an SDE. This SDE, often called the \"forward SDE,\" models the evolution of the data distribution over time as it is corrupted by noise. The physical process of diffusion is governed by the Fokker-Planck equation (also known as the forward Kolmogorov equation), which describes the time evolution of the probability density function of the particle positions. In the context of diffusion models, the forward process is designed such that the probability density of \\( x_t \\), denoted \\( q(x_t) \\), evolves according to a similar principle, eventually converging to the standard Gaussian prior \\( \\mathcal{N}(0, \\mathbf{I}) \\) as \\( t \\to \\infty \\). This mathematical formulation provides a rigorous framework for understanding how the data distribution is systematically destroyed [9].\n\nThe crucial insight that bridges this physical process to generative modeling is the concept of reversing the diffusion. While the forward process of increasing entropy is a natural physical phenomenon, the reverse process of decreasing entropy (i.e., creating order from disorder) requires external work or control. In the context of generative models, this \"control\" is the learned neural network. The goal is to learn the reverse-time SDE that, when applied to pure noise, generates samples from the original data distribution. This is analogous to Maxwell's demon, a thought experiment where an intelligent being sorts fast and slow molecules, seemingly violating the second law of thermodynamics by decreasing entropy. In diffusion models, the neural network acts as this \"demon,\" learning to guide the system back to the low-entropy data manifold. The theoretical foundation for this reversal was established in works like [10], which showed that if one can learn the score function (the gradient of the log-probability density) of the perturbed data distribution at each noise level, one can construct the reverse-time SDE. This score function essentially tells the model how to \"denoise\" the data at each step, pushing it back towards the data distribution.\n\nThe concept of entropy production plays a central role in this framework. In non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the rate of entropy production quantifies how far a system is from equilibrium. In the forward diffusion process, entropy is continuously produced as the system moves away from the data distribution. The reverse process, to be successful, must effectively \"undo\" this entropy production. The training objective of diffusion models can be interpreted as minimizing a variational upper bound on the negative log-likelihood, which is closely related to the total entropy change. The work of [11] provides a transparent physics analysis, formulating concepts like the fluctuation theorem and entropy production to understand the dynamic process. They treat the reverse diffusion generative process as a statistical inference problem, where the time-dependent state variables serve as quenched disorder, a concept borrowed from spin glass theory. This perspective links stochastic thermodynamics, statistical inference, and geometry to provide a coherent picture of how diffusion models work.\n\nFurthermore, the connection to thermodynamics is not just a historical curiosity but a source of ongoing theoretical insights. For instance, the speed-accuracy trade-off in diffusion models can be analyzed through the lens of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The work in [12] derives a fundamental trade-off relationship between the speed of data generation and its accuracy, showing that the entropy production rate in the forward process directly affects the errors in data generation. This provides a quantitative, physics-grounded understanding of the limits of acceleration in diffusion models.\n\nThe thermodynamic analogy also extends to the concept of free energy. The generative process can be viewed as a trajectory in probability space that minimizes a certain functional, analogous to how physical systems evolve to minimize their free energy. The reverse-time SDE can be derived from an action principle, similar to those used in physics, as shown in [13]. This action principle connects score matching to a variational problem, reinforcing the deep physical interpretation of the generative process. Moreover, the connection to the Fokker-Planck equation is fundamental. The evolution of the probability density during the reverse process is governed by the Fokker-Planck equation associated with the reverse-time SDE. Understanding this equation is key to analyzing the properties of the generated distribution. For example, [14] points out that the scores learned by standard denoising score matching may not perfectly satisfy the underlying score Fokker-Planck equation, and proposes regularization to enforce this self-consistency, thereby improving model performance.\n\nThe thermodynamic perspective also helps explain the memorization phenomenon observed in some diffusion models. Just as a physical system can get \"stuck\" in a local energy minimum (a metastable state), a diffusion model can get \"stuck\" in its training data. The process of generating samples can be seen as navigating an energy landscape. If the model has not properly learned the global structure of the data distribution, it may simply reconstruct or \"memorize\" training examples. The work in [15] uses tools from equilibrium statistical mechanics to show that generative diffusion models undergo phase transitions. They argue that memorization can be understood as a form of critical condensation corresponding to a disordered phase transition. This provides a powerful statistical physics framework for understanding the transition from memorization to generalization.\n\nIn summary, the origins of generative diffusion models in non-equilibrium thermodynamics provide a rich and coherent conceptual framework. The forward process is a direct analogue of physical diffusion, a process of increasing entropy that gradually destroys the structure of data. The reverse process is a learned, controlled reversal of this diffusion, akin to a Maxwellian demon, which requires the model to learn the underlying score function to guide the system back to the low-entropy data manifold. This connection is not merely inspirational; it is formalized through SDEs, the Fokker-Planck equation, and concepts like entropy production and free energy minimization. This physical grounding provides deep insights into the training dynamics, sampling behavior, fundamental limitations, and even the failure modes of diffusion models, making it a cornerstone of their theoretical understanding.\n\n### 1.4 Evolution from Score-Based Methods\n\nThe evolution of generative diffusion models is inextricably linked to the development of score-based methods, which shifted the paradigm of density estimation from explicit likelihood calculation to learning the gradient of the log-probability density, known as the score. This approach provided a powerful alternative to the models discussed in the previous section, addressing their limitations. Before the advent of diffusion models, generative modeling faced significant challenges in scaling to high-dimensional data. While models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) showed promise, they suffered from issues like blurry samples (VAEs) or mode collapse and training instability (GANs). In this context, score matching emerged as a theoretically elegant alternative for learning data distributions without requiring explicit normalization.\n\nThe foundational concept of score matching was introduced by Hyv\u00e4rinen, proposing a method to learn the score function by minimizing the Fisher Divergence between the model and the data distribution. However, applying this to high-dimensional spaces proved difficult due to the \"curse of dimensionality.\" To address this, Vincent et al. proposed Denoising Score Matching (DSM), which simplified the objective by operating on data perturbed by Gaussian noise. Instead of matching the score of the clean data distribution, DSM trains a neural network to predict the score of the perturbed distribution. This approach demonstrated that learning the score function was feasible and effective for density estimation, laying the groundwork for subsequent generative modeling techniques [16].\n\nDespite the success of DSM, generating samples from the learned score function remained a non-trivial task. Early attempts relied on Langevin dynamics, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique that uses the score to guide a random walk towards high-probability regions. While theoretically sound, these methods were computationally expensive and required many steps to produce high-quality samples. The critical breakthrough came with the realization that the process of gradually adding noise to data\u2014a diffusion process\u2014could be mathematically reversed using the learned score function. This connection bridged the gap between score-based methods and probabilistic diffusion processes, directly linking to the thermodynamic principles of reversing entropy increase that were foundational to the field.\n\nThe modern formulation of score-based generative modeling crystallized in works like [17]. This paper unified previous approaches by framing the generative process as the reversal of a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). It introduced a systematic way to transform a complex data distribution into a simple Gaussian noise distribution (the forward process) and then reverse this process to generate data (the reverse process). Crucially, the reverse SDE depends entirely on the time-dependent score function of the perturbed data distributions. By leveraging neural networks to estimate these scores and using numerical SDE solvers, this framework achieved state-of-the-art results in image generation.\n\nThe theoretical underpinnings of these models were further solidified by establishing connections to other fields. For instance, [18] provided a variational framework for likelihood estimation, showing that minimizing the score-matching loss is equivalent to maximizing a lower bound on the likelihood of the reverse SDE. This work helped bridge the theoretical gap, explaining why score matching is effective for generative modeling. Similarly, [5] unified the variational and score-based perspectives, demonstrating that optimizing a diffusion model essentially boils down to learning a score function to predict noise or the original data from a noisified input.\n\nHowever, the reliance on SDEs introduced complexities in sampling efficiency. The need to discretize the reverse-time SDE into many small steps to ensure stability and quality led to slow inference speeds. This spurred research into more efficient solvers and alternative formulations. For example, [19] explored deterministic Probability Flow ODEs as an alternative to stochastic SDEs, offering potentially faster sampling with better theoretical guarantees. The distinction between stochastic and deterministic reverse processes became a key area of study, with [20] arguing that stochasticity in the reverse process actually enhances the model's ability to approximate complex distributions, explaining the empirical success of stochastic samplers over deterministic ones.\n\nAs the field matured, researchers sought to understand the fundamental properties of score-based generative models. [21] provided convergence guarantees for score-based models, assuming accurate score estimates, and showed that these models can efficiently sample from essentially any realistic data distribution. This theoretical validation was crucial for justifying the empirical success of diffusion models. Furthermore, [22] offered polynomial convergence guarantees without restrictive assumptions on the data distribution, reinforcing the robustness of the approach.\n\nThe evolution also involved exploring the geometry of the generative process. [23] interpreted the forward and backward processes as Wasserstein gradient flows, providing a geometric perspective that led to intuitive solutions for faster sampling. This view connects diffusion models to optimal transport theory, specifically the Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge problem, which seeks the most likely stochastic trajectory between two distributions. [24] and [25] further explored these connections, highlighting how score matching can be viewed as solving an optimal transport problem.\n\nDespite these advances, challenges remained. The standard Gaussian noise assumption in Denoising Score Matching was identified as a limitation in high-dimensional spaces. [26] extended the theory to broader families of noise distributions, such as the generalized normal distribution, to improve score estimation in high dimensions. Similarly, [27] proposed using nonlinear noising dynamics to better capture structured distributions, addressing issues like multimodality and approximate symmetries.\n\nThe practical implementation of score-based models also saw significant innovations. To address the computational cost of training and sampling, methods like [28] were proposed, which embed pre-computed scores to accelerate training. Additionally, [29] explored non-neural approaches, using smoothed closed-form scores to generate novel samples without training, offering a competitive alternative to neural SGMs.\n\nThe application of score-based models expanded beyond unconditional generation. [30] systematically compared methods for learning conditional distributions, introducing a multi-speed diffusion framework. This evolution towards conditional generation was pivotal for tasks like text-to-image synthesis and solving inverse problems. [31] demonstrated how score-based priors could be used for Bayesian inference in function spaces, a significant step for scientific applications.\n\nIn summary, the evolution from early score-based methods to modern diffusion models represents a convergence of ideas from score matching, stochastic calculus, and optimal transport. It began with the simple idea of learning the gradient of the log-density [24] and evolved into a sophisticated framework capable of generating high-fidelity samples across diverse modalities. The journey from Denoising Score Matching to SDE-based generation, and the ongoing refinements in theory, architecture, and sampling efficiency, underscores the dynamic nature of this field. The foundational work of [17] and the theoretical insights from [18] serve as the bedrock upon which the current generation of generative AI is built. As the field continues to mature, the principles established by these early score-based methods remain central to understanding and advancing generative diffusion models. This progression from abstract score-based theory to practical, efficient architectures sets the stage for the next major leap: the transition to latent diffusion, which will be discussed in the following section.\n\n### 1.5 Modern Denoising and Latent Diffusion Paradigms\n\nThe transition from theoretical foundations to practical, high-fidelity generative modeling is marked by the emergence of modern denoising and latent diffusion paradigms. These advancements represent a pivotal shift in the application of diffusion processes, moving from abstract mathematical formulations to scalable architectures capable of synthesizing complex, high-dimensional data. The core innovation lies in the refinement of the denoising objective and the strategic relocation of the diffusion process to a compressed latent space, thereby addressing the computational bottlenecks inherent in earlier pixel-space models.\n\nThe cornerstone of the modern denoising paradigm is the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). Introduced in the seminal work [10], DDPMs established a robust framework for generating high-quality images by modeling the reverse of a Markovian noising process. Unlike earlier approaches that relied heavily on variational bounds, the DDPM objective simplifies the training to a reweighted mean-squared error between the predicted noise and the actual noise added to the data. This simple yet effective objective enabled the generation of samples that rival the quality of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) while offering stable training dynamics. The authors of [10] demonstrated that this approach could achieve state-of-the-art results on unconditional image generation benchmarks like CIFAR-10 and LSUN, marking a significant milestone in generative modeling.\n\nFollowing the success of DDPMs, the research community focused on refining the model's capabilities and efficiency. The work [32] highlighted that these models could not only produce high-quality samples but also achieve competitive log-likelihoods, a metric where they previously lagged. Furthermore, this paper introduced the crucial concept of learning the variances of the reverse diffusion process, which allowed for sampling with significantly fewer forward passes without a noticeable degradation in quality. This refinement was essential for making diffusion models more practical for real-world applications where inference speed is a critical constraint.\n\nHowever, even with these improvements, the computational cost of operating in high-dimensional pixel space remained a formidable challenge. The sequential nature of the denoising process, requiring hundreds or thousands of steps, meant that generating high-resolution images was prohibitively slow. To overcome this, the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) paradigm was introduced. The core idea of LDMs is to perform the diffusion process in a lower-dimensional latent space rather than directly on the pixels. This is achieved by first compressing the data into a compact representation using an autoencoder, typically a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The diffusion model then learns to denoise data within this compressed latent space. Because the dimensionality of the latent space is much lower than that of the pixel space, the denoising network can be significantly smaller and faster, leading to substantial gains in computational efficiency.\n\nThe shift to latent space not only improves speed but also enhances generation quality. By offloading the burden of high-frequency detail synthesis to the decoder of the autoencoder, the diffusion model can focus on learning the global structure and semantics of the data. This separation of concerns allows for more efficient training and higher-fidelity results. The effectiveness of this approach has been validated across various domains, as demonstrated in [33], which successfully applied LDMs to generate complex climate simulations, and [34], which extended the paradigm to continuous functions and 3D geometry.\n\nWhile LDMs address the efficiency bottleneck, further innovations have been proposed to optimize the diffusion process itself. For instance, [35] introduced a framework where the size of the neural network is adapted according to the importance of each generative step. This step-aware approach reduces redundant computations in less critical steps, further enhancing efficiency without compromising quality. Similarly, [36] proposed a method for compressing pre-trained diffusion models by identifying and removing unimportant weights, enabling significant reductions in computational cost with minimal retraining.\n\nThe evolution of diffusion models is also characterized by the exploration of alternative mathematical formulations. The work [37] challenges the necessity of the traditional denoising framework, proposing instead to construct diffusion processes targeting the data distribution through mixtures of diffusion bridges. This perspective offers greater flexibility in choosing the underlying dynamics and provides a unified view of drift adjustments. Furthermore, [38] reframes the sampling process as solving differential equations on manifolds, leading to the development of pseudo numerical methods that can accelerate sampling while maintaining high quality.\n\nIn summary, the modern denoising and latent diffusion paradigms represent a convergence of theoretical insights and practical engineering. From the foundational [10] to the efficient [39] and the various optimization techniques like [35] and [36], these advancements have transformed diffusion models from a theoretical curiosity into a powerful and versatile tool for generative AI. The transition to latent space and the refinement of the denoising objective have been instrumental in achieving both high quality and computational feasibility, paving the way for the widespread adoption of diffusion models in diverse applications.\n\n## 2 Theoretical Foundations and Mathematical Formulations\n\n### 2.1 Forward and Reverse Processes: SDEs and Probability Flow ODEs\n\n### 2.2
